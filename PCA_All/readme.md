#Ancestry control
The combined dataset was divided into the samples from present study (./study), and the 1000genomes samples (in ./reference). 
The file containing regions of high linkage disequilibrium come from the [plinkQC](https://meyer-lab-cshl.github.io/plinkQC/articles/AncestryCheck.html) R package.
The Genomes1000_PopColors.txt file was edited as a local copy to give more readable color palette.
The analysis steps can be found in *ancestry.sh*, R code for plotting is in *ancestry.R*.
